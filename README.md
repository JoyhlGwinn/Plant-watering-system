# Plant Watering System

This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development of our Plant Watering System project for ECE 1000.

# Project Summary

Having a plant requires mantinence, resources, and time to keep it alive. In some cases, people do not have the these qualities in
their lives to keep the plant. This project would help minigate the time and resources needed to water a plant. The end product
would be that the plant is watered when the soil becomes dry, and stops when the soil becomes wet. This saves water by not watsting
it when it is not needed and time since the owner would not have to constantly water the plant.

# Project Capabilities

The first iteration of our projcet focused on simpily detecting the moisture level of the plant. A moisture sensor, a relay, a water pump, and a Raspberry Pi Pico
were used to implement our project. The following details the capablilites of the Watering System.

* Capable of sensing moisture level of soil using a moisture sensor
* Capable of pumping water into the plant using a waterpump
